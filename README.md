Hi, I'm Lumyx and I create websites using the MERN stack.

I'm a self-taught developer, using the MERN stack and have started learning web-development about 2 years ago. I'm currently expanding my web-development knowledge with new libraries and currently, am focusing on database work with MongoDB. Whilst I put alot of work into the server-side backend of my projects, im passionate about UI and UX and creating good-looking websites with tailwind CSS. I'm currently expanding into the development of mobile apps using react-native and hope to soon create apps which everyone can use.
